# Simple Blockchain Implementation in Python

## Introduction to Blockchain

Blockchain is a revolutionary technology that enables secure and immutable data storage. It consists of a series of blocks linked together through cryptographic hashes, ensuring the integrity and security of the information. Each block contains data, its own hash, and the hash of the previous block, creating an interconnected structure that is difficult to manipulate.

## Advantages of Blockchain

- **Security**: Cryptographic hashing and decentralization make it difficult for attackers to alter the data.
- **Transparency**: Any change in the blockchain is visible to all participants, ensuring trust.
- **Immutability**: Once data is recorded in a block, it cannot be modified, making blockchain ideal for secure record-keeping.
- **Decentralization**: No central authority controls the blockchain, reducing the risk of corruption and fraud.

## Code Bibliography

This implementation is based on fundamental blockchain principles, including:

- **Cryptographic Hashing**: SHA-256 hashing algorithm is used to secure block data.
- **Proof of Work (PoW)**: A simple PoW mechanism is implemented to validate blocks.
- **Blockchain Data Structure**: Each block is linked to the previous one using hashes.

## How to Run the Code

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Steps to Run

The code is in a python notebook provided you have both python and jupyternotebook installed you should be able ot run it's cells.
